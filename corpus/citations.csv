b. Concerns Over Unit Root (Applicable to the Regression Models Only) 
The Other Retail regression models rely on previous values of net charge-off rates (and in the 
case of the International Cards Model, delinquency rates) to project values of these variables in a 
given period.  As described in Section G.ii.b.(1), models that rely on previous values of the 
outcome variables are referred to as “autoregressive.","Generally with autoregressive 
specifications, there are technical concerns that they may not be mean-reverting, meaning the 
model’s behavior might not necessarily return to a long-term average after a shock",proposed_stress_test_model_documentation_credit_risk_models.pdf,NBER,https://www.nber.org/papers/w33857,https://www.nber.org/system/files/working_papers/w33857/w33857.pdf,33857
